MNIST Binary Classification using Pytorch

Two approaches to Binary classification using Pytorch.

The Linear SVM approach could reach 99% accuracy. This was done with 1 linear layer with hinge loss.

The Logistic Regression approach could reach 99% accuracy. This was done with 1 linear layer with logistic loss.

Logistic_Regression.py will print the Average Losses and final testing accuracy for the 1st ten epochs of a Logistic Regression SGD model with step size 1e-1.

Linear_SVM.py will print the Average Losses and final testing accuracy for the 1st ten epochs of a Linear SVM SGD model with step size 1e-2.

This was an assignment(HW1) in UCLA's CS260 Machine Learning Algorithms
